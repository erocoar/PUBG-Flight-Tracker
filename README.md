# PUBG-Flight-Tracker
keeping track of flight route in PUBG

there's some web based versions of this already but this is for people who prefer a kind of overlay to tab in quickly while ingame

## features
- draw flight line with mouseclick/drag
- jump and parachute area is displayed and can be toggled on/off with 'Toggle Parachute' button
- '(Re)Start' button clears window
- 'Toggle (Car/Boat) Spawns' button toggles the display of likely spawns (based on ShatterNL's PUBG Map v.06)
- set (and remove) your own markers (blue) with right click
- set (and remove) danger markers (yellow) with middle click

## how to use
- open flighttracker.exe
- place the window **so that it covers your pubg map**, resize accordingly (should be a square)
- **click the 'Toggle Window Frame Button'** to enable transparency
- use!
