# PUBG-Flight-Tracker
keeping track of flight route in PUBG

there's some online versions of this already but this is for people who prefer a kind of overlay to tab in quickly while ingame

features:
- draw flight line with mouseclick/drag
- jump and parachute area is displayed and can be toggled on/off with 'Toggle Parachute' button
- '(Re)Start' button clears window
- set (and remove) markers with right click

!the program is meant to be placed right on top of the ingame PUBG map and set to low opacity!
